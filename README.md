<header># From Creation to New Creation: How Jesus Restores All Things  

## **The State of Nothingness**  
In the beginning, there was **nothing**—no life, no light, and no hope.  
Like a crumpled paper, **the world was worthless and useless**.  
But before the beginning, there was **God**, and **the Spirit of God** hovered above the face of the waters.  

---

## **The Power of Creation**  
> **Genesis 1:1** – "In the beginning God created The Heavens and the earth."  

The **Heavens**, the dwelling place of the Most High God, was hidden in secrecy.  
It remained **unknown to men** until **Jesus**, the One who was with the Father from the beginning, came to live among us.  

> **Genesis 1:2** – "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep, and The Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters."  

Then, **God spoke**:  

> **Genesis 1:3** – "And God said, Let there be light, and there was light."  

God saw that the light was **good** and separated it from darkness, creating **day and night**.  
In a similar manner, He **called everything into existence** by the **Word from His mouth**, making a **perfect world** out of **nothingness, uselessness, and worthlessness**.  

And so, it is safe to say:  

> **The world was absolutely chaotic until it came into contact with the Word of God, which is Jesus.**  

---

## **Jesus: The Word That Created All Things**  
> **John 1:1-5 (NIV)**  
> "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made. In Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."  

Everything exists **because of the spoken Word of God**—which means **Jesus is the reason and Owner of all existence**.

## **Whose Beginning Is Genesis Talking About?**  
The **Bible is a spiritual representation of our physical world**.  
So, the **"beginning"** in Genesis refers to the **beginning of the life of Men**.  

- Life without **Jesus** is chaotic, without form, and full of darkness.  
- But when it comes into contact with **the Word (Jesus)**, everything changes.  
- The Word **lives in our hearts**, transforming us into **a glorious and perfect land** fit for a **better life**.  
- He brings **hope into nothingness**, **light into darkness**, and **life in place of death**.

## Step 1: Create a branch

_Welcome to "Introduction to GitHub"! :wave:_

**What is GitHub?**: GitHub is a collaboration platform that uses _[Git](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#git)_ for versioning. GitHub is a popular place to share and contribute to [open-source](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#open-source) software.

**What is a repository?**: A _[repository](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#repository)_ is a project containing files and folders. A repository tracks versions of files and folders. For more information, see "[About repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories)" from GitHub Docs.

**What is a branch?**: A _[branch](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary#branch)_ is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named `main` and it is considered to be the definitive branch. Creating additional branches allows you to copy the `main` branch of your repository and safely make any changes without disrupting the main project. Many people use branches to work on specific features without affecting any other parts of the project.

Branches allow you to separate your work from the `main` branch. In other words, everyone's work is safe while you contribute. For more information, see "[About branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)".

**What is a profile README?**: A _[profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)_ is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page. For more information, see "[Managing your profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme)".

### :keyboard: Activity: Your first branch

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to your newly made repository. Then, work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the **< > Code** tab in the header menu of your repository.

   ![code-tab](/images/code-tab.png)

3. Click on the **main** branch drop-down.

   ![main-branch-dropdown](/images/main-branch-dropdown.png)

4. In the field, name your branch `my-first-branch`. In this case, the name must be `my-first-branch` to trigger the course workflow.
5. Click **Create branch: my-first-branch** to create your branch.

   ![create-branch-button](/images/create-branch-button.png)

   The branch will automatically switch to the one you have just created.
   The **main** branch drop-down bar will reflect your new branch and display the new branch name.

6. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
